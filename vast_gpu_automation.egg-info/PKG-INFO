# Vast.ai GPU CLI

CLI tool for managing GPU instances on Vast.ai marketplace.

## Why This Tool?

Training ML/AI models requires GPU power, but cloud GPU pricing varies constantly. Vast.ai is a GPU marketplace where prices can be 5-10x cheaper than AWS/GCP, but managing instances manually is tedious and error-prone.

**This tool automates the workflow:**
- Search hundreds of GPU offers instantly, sorted by price or performance
- Launch instances with a single command
- Get SSH access automatically when the instance is ready
- Upload/download files and run commands remotely
- Manage multiple instances at once
- Track costs and billing in real-time

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup (one time)
make install
cp .env.example .env          # Add your API key from https://cloud.vast.ai/account/
make ssh-setup                # Generate and upload SSH key

# Workflow
make cheap                    # Find cheap GPUs (<$0.04/hr)
make launch ID=<offer_id>     # Launch instance (note the instance_id returned)
make upload ID=<instance_id> SRC=./examples
make run ID=<instance_id> CMD='python3 /root/examples/cuda_test.py'
make destroy ID=<instance_id> # Clean up when done
```

> **Note:** `make launch` uses an **offer ID** (from search results). All other commands use the **instance ID** (returned after launch).

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter directory
cd gpu

# 2. Install dependencies
make install

# 3. Configure API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API key from https://cloud.vast.ai/account/

# 4. Setup SSH key (generates key if needed and uploads to Vast.ai)
make ssh-setup
```

## Usage

### Search GPUs

```bash
# List all available GPUs (cheapest first)
make search

# Filter by max price
make search PRICE=0.15

# Filter by GPU model
make search GPU=RTX_4090

# Combine filters
make search GPU=RTX_4090 PRICE=0.20

# Quick search: cheap GPUs with best price/performance
make cheap              # Under $0.04/hr, sorted by value
make cheap PRICE=0.06   # Override price limit
```

### Launch Instances

```bash
# Launch by offer ID (from search results)
make launch ID=12345

# Launch multiple instances
make launch ID=12345,67890

# Use different Docker image
make launch ID=12345 IMAGE=tensorflow
```

Available images: `pytorch` (default), `tensorflow`, `cuda`, `cuda_devel`

### Manage Instances

```bash
# List your instances
make list

# Get SSH command
make ssh ID=12345

# Start/stop instance
make start ID=12345
make stop ID=12345

# Destroy instance
make destroy ID=12345

# Destroy all instances
make destroy-all        # with confirmation
make destroy-all-force  # skip confirmation
```

### File Transfer

```bash
# Upload files to instance
make upload ID=12345 SRC=./examples

# Upload to specific directory
make upload ID=12345 SRC=./script.py DST=/root/work/

# Download files from instance
make download ID=12345 SRC=/root/results

# Download to specific local directory
make download ID=12345 SRC=/root/model.pt DST=./models/
```

### Remote Execution

```bash
# Run a command on the instance
make run ID=12345 CMD='nvidia-smi'

# Run a Python script
make run ID=12345 CMD='python3 /root/examples/cuda_test.py'

# Run multiple commands
make run ID=12345 CMD='cd /root && python3 train.py'
```

### Account Info

```bash
# Check balance
make balance

# View billing history
make billing

# List available Docker images
make images
```

## Examples

The `examples/` folder contains test scripts:

- `cuda_test.py` - Tests CUDA directly using nvidia-smi (works with any image)
- `pytorch_test.py` - Tests PyTorch GPU (requires PyTorch installed)

```bash
# Full example workflow
make cheap                                              # Find GPU
make launch ID=28347297                                 # Launch (returns instance ID, e.g., 29001783)
make upload ID=29001783 SRC=./examples                  # Upload test scripts
make run ID=29001783 CMD='python3 /root/examples/cuda_test.py'  # Run test
make destroy ID=29001783                                # Clean up
```
